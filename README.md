For Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), taxation in India can be complex, especially when it comes to Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). One effective way to reduce TDS liability is by applying for a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs. This certificate helps in reducing the applicable TDS rate on income earned in India, ensuring that NRIs are not overburdened with tax deductions at source.

What is a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate?

A Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs is issued under Section 197 of the Income Tax Act, allowing NRIs to request a lower TDS rate on specific transactions, such as the sale of property, rental income, or capital gains. This certificate is particularly beneficial for those who expect their total tax liability to be lower than the standard TDS rate.

When Should NRIs Apply for a Lower TDS Certificate?

NRIs should consider applying for a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs in the following scenarios:

Selling Property in India: The standard TDS for NRI on sale of property is typically 20% (plus surcharge and cess) on long-term capital gains. However, if the actual tax liability is lower due to exemptions or deductions, an NRI can apply for a lower TDS certificate.

Receiving Rental Income: Rental income received by NRIs is subject to TDS at 30%. If the NRI’s actual tax liability is lower, they can apply for a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs to reduce the TDS rate.

Capital Gains on Investments: If an NRI has capital gains from shares, mutual funds, or other investments, applying for a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs can help in reducing TDS.

Salary or Business Income: NRIs earning income from an Indian employer or business can also benefit from a lower TDS rate if they meet certain tax criteria.

How to Apply for a Lower TDS Certificate?

The application process for a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs is as follows:

Filing Form 13: NRIs need to submit Form 13 Income Tax for NRI to the jurisdictional Assessing Officer (AO).

Providing Necessary Documents: Supporting documents include PAN, tax computation, past income tax returns, and proof of exemptions.

Application Processing: The AO verifies the application and may request additional documents.

Certificate Issuance: Once approved, the certificate is issued, allowing the payer to deduct tax at the specified lower rate.

TDS Refund Process for NRIs

In case an NRI has already paid excess TDS, they can initiate the TDS refund process for NRIs by filing an income tax return in India. The refund is processed after assessment by the Income Tax Department.

TDS Rate for NRI Property Sale

The standard TDS rate for NRI property sale depends on the holding period:

Long-term capital gains (held for more than 2 years): 20% (plus surcharge and cess).

Short-term capital gains (held for less than 2 years): Taxed as per applicable income tax slab rates.

NRIs can apply for a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs to reduce the TDS burden on property sales.

TDS on Sale of Property by NRI

The TDS on sale of property by NRI is deducted by the buyer before making payment to the NRI seller. If the seller is eligible for a lower tax rate, they can apply for a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs to minimize tax deductions.

Conclusion

Applying for a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate for NRIs can significantly reduce tax liabilities and prevent excess TDS deductions. Whether it’s the TDS refund process for NRIs or ensuring a lower TDS on sale of property by NRI, understanding the process is essential for financial efficiency.
